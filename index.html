      <h2>Is information security a top ten in demand career field? What career fields are more in demand?</h2>
      <p>Yes, information security is consistently ranked among the top ten most in-demand career fields. In fact, according to a report by Burning Glass Technologies, a labor market analytics firm, information security is the second most in-demand field in the United States, with a projected growth rate of 32% from 2018 to 2028.

Other career fields that are currently in demand include finance and accounting, marketing and sales, and skilled trades such as electricians and plumbers.
